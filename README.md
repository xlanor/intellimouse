Userland driver for Intellimouse Explorer Pro in golang for linux.

Written because I wanted to get a better understanding of the USB protocol and reverse engineering.

Still a work in progress, I plan to add a frontend with wails

Acknowledgements:

- [Kim Visscher](https://github.com/k-visscher/intellimouse-ctl) for doing the bulk of reverse engineering and writing the code, I started doing it before I realised somebody else had already done it. I'll try to add the other functionality
